# Stage 3 — Technical Documentation

## 1. User Stories

The prioritization method used is **MoSCoW**.

| Priority    | User Story                                                                                |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Must Have   | As a user, I want to sign in securely so I can access my personal dashboard.              |
| Must Have   | As a user, I want to browse the company and employee directory to find useful contacts.   |
| Must Have   | As an employee, I want to view available trainings so I can improve my skills.            |
| Must Have   | As a user, I want to send and receive messages to communicate with other members.         |
| Must Have   | As a user, I want to read economic news so I can stay informed.                           |
| Must Have   | As an administrator, I want to manage users and companies to administer the platform.     |
| Should Have | As a user, I want to quickly search content to save time.                                 |
| Should Have | As a user, I want to update my profile to keep my information current.                    |
| Could Have  | As a user, I want to receive notifications for important events so I don't miss anything. |
| Could Have  | As an admin, I want usage statistics to track product adoption.                           |
| Won't Have  | As a user, I want a native mobile app for phone usage (out of scope for MVP).             |

## 3. System Architecture

The chosen architecture is a standard web architecture with a clear separation between frontend, backend, database and real-time components.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
	User[User] --> F[Frontend]
	Admin[Administrator] --> F
	F --> B[Backend]
	B --> D[(PostgreSQL)]
	B --> N[External news service]
	B --> R[Real-time / WebSockets]
	R --> F
```

### 3.1 Architecture Choices

- **Frontend**: React for UI and routing.
- **Backend**: REST API (Flask) for business operations.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for persistence.
- **Real-time**: WebSockets for messaging.
- **Security**: JWT authentication and role-based access control.

## 4. Components, Classes and Data Model

Main business components identified:

- users,
- companies,
- trainings,
- enrollments,
- messages,
- news,
- notifications.

### 4.1 Main Entities

- **User**: UUID, email used as login identifier, username aligned with email, password, roles (admin flags), profile info, active status and audit fields.
- **Company**: UUID, name, description, picture, associated admin, active status and audit fields.
- **Training**: UUID, title, description, picture, active status and audit fields.
- **Enrollment**: relation between a user and a training.
- **Message**: author, recipient or room, content, timestamp.
- **Notification**: content, read status, recipient.

#### BaseClass

All persistent entities inherit from a `BaseClass` that centralizes common audit fields to avoid duplication and standardize the model:

- `uuid` / `id` (PK)
- `is_active` (bool)
- `created_at` (datetime)
- `updated_at` (datetime)
- `deactivate_by` (uuid FK)
- `delete_by` (uuid FK)

Entities (`User`, `Company`, `Training`, `Enrollment`, `Message`, `Notification`) extend `BaseClass` and add domain-specific attributes.

### 4.2 ER Diagram

```mermaid
erDiagram
	%% BaseClass centralizes common audit fields
	BASECLASS {
		uuid id PK
		bool is_active
		datetime created_at
		datetime updated_at
		uuid deactivate_by FK
		uuid delete_by FK
	}

	COMPANY {
		uuid id PK
		string name
		string description
		string company_picture
		string website_link
		uuid admin_id FK
	}

	USER {
		uuid id PK
		uuid company_id FK
		bool is_super_admin
		bool is_admin
		string email
		string password
		string first_name
		string last_name
		string bio
		string phone
		string profile_picture
		string business_card
	}

	TRAINING {
		uuid id PK
		uuid company_id FK
		string title
		string description
		string picture
	}

	ENROLLMENT {
		uuid id PK
		uuid user_id FK
		uuid training_id FK
		datetime enrolled_at
	}

	MESSAGE {
		uuid id PK
		uuid author_id FK
		uuid recipient_id FK
		uuid conversation_id FK
		string content
		datetime created_at
	}

	NOTIFICATION {
		uuid id PK
		uuid recipient_id FK
		string content
		bool is_read
		datetime created_at
	}

	%% Relations (cardinalities)
	COMPANY ||--o{ USER : employs
	COMPANY ||--o{ TRAINING : organizes
	TRAINING ||--o{ ENROLLMENT : contains
	USER ||--o{ ENROLLMENT : joins
	USER ||--o{ MESSAGE : sends
	USER ||--o{ NOTIFICATION : gets
```

### 4.3 Design Rules

- a user belongs to a single primary company,
- a training can have multiple enrollees,
- an enrollment must be unique per user/training pair,
- messages must be traceable,
- data must be filtered by visibility scope (company/role) where applicable.

## 5. Sequence Diagrams

High-level sequences document the main interactions.

### 5.1 Login and dashboard access

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
	participant U as User
	participant F as Frontend
	participant B as Backend API
	participant D as Database

	U->>F: Enter credentials
	F->>B: POST /auth/login
	B->>D: Verify user
	D-->>B: Valid account
	B-->>F: JWT token + profile
	F-->>U: Display dashboard
```

### 5.2 Company creation and account activation

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
	participant SA as Super Admin
	participant C as Company
	participant A as Company Admin
	participant U as Employee

	SA->>C: Create Company
	SA->>A: Create Company Admin
	A->>A: First login + set password
	A->>U: Create User
	U->>U: First login + set password
```

### 5.3 Real-time messaging

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
	participant U1 as User A
	participant F as Frontend
	participant W as WebSocket Server
	participant U2 as User B

	U1->>F: Send message
	F->>W: Message real-time event
	W-->>F: Broadcast message
	F-->>U2: Display conversation
```

## 6. API Specifications

### 6.1 External APIs

The project may consume or fetch economic news from external APIs or feeds. Requirements:

- fetch economic news,
- filter by topic or source,
- normalize data before display.

### 6.2 Internal APIs — CRUD endpoints detailed

General conventions:

- Pagination: `GET` list endpoints accept `?page=1&per_page=20`.
- Filtering: `?q=term`, field-specific filters (e.g. `?is_active=true`).
- Sorting: `?sort=created_at,-title` (`-` prefix for descending).
- Responses: standard `200`, `201`, `204`, `400`, `401`, `403`, `404`, `409`, `422`, `500`.
- Soft delete: `DELETE` marks `is_active=false` and populates `delete_by` and `deleted_at` if applicable.

### 6.3 Input / Output Formats

Examples (abridged):

Create User

```json
{
  "first_name": "Guillaume",
  "last_name": "Salva",
  "email": "guillaume@example.com",
  "password": "secret",
  "company_id": "uuid-company"
}
```

Create Company

```json
{
  "name": "Acme Corp",
  "description": "Company",
  "website_link": "https://acme.example"
}
```

Create Training

```json
{
  "title": "Project Management",
  "description": "Basic training",
  "company_id": "uuid-company"
}
```

Create Message

```json
{
  "content": "Hello",
  "attachments": []
}
```

Create Enrollment

```json
{
  "user_id": "uuid-user",
  "training_id": "uuid-training"
}
```

### 6.4 API Security Constraints

- authentication required for private routes,
- role-based access control (RBAC) and JWT scopes,
- company-level filtering to prevent multi-tenant data leaks,
- strict input validation (JSON Schema / pydantic),
- rate limiting on sensitive endpoints (auth, messages),
- anti-abuse measures for WS (auth, origin checks, per-connection limits),
- soft-delete and audit: store `created_by`, `updated_by`, `deactivate_by`, `delete_by` and timestamps,
- standardized error responses (RFC7807 problem+json),
- audit logging for sensitive operations (delete, role changes).

### 11.1 Test Strategy

- iterative development,
- cover critical use-cases first,
- review bugs before client sign-off,
- use Jest for frontend/TypeScript when applicable,
- document incidents and fixes.

## 12. Technical Rationale

Technical choices are justified by the project's business needs:

- centralize information and communication,
- deliver an MVP reachable in ~12 weeks,
- support real-time messaging,
- keep a simple and maintainable structure,
- allow scalability,
- secure access by company and role,
- enable regular client validation.

## 13. Conclusion

Stage 3 formalizes the technical preparation for the Maison de l'Economie Dashboard project. It synthesizes business needs, the MVP scope, risks, architecture decisions and quality requirements to serve as a development baseline.
